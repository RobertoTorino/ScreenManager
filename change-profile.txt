This will work but if the bit depth of the image doesn't match the original, the colours will be changed/inverted.
Although that matters little if you just wanna get rid of the bald chemist.

You need to add 3 BMP files to the game folder (your profile pic in 32x32 pixels, 64x64 and 184x184) where steam_emu.in is located.
Can do this with Paint: open the image file with Paint, resize image with the stated pixels, and then save it as a .bmp file.
End result is three .bmp files that are named

(1) Avatar32.bmp

(2) Avatar64.bmp

(3) Avatar184.bmp

Then add the following to the steamemu.ini file (open it with Notepad):

[Avatar]

###

### Bitmap Avatar files

###

### 32x32 Pixel

Small=Avatar32.bmp

###

### 64x64 Pixel

Medium=Avatar64.bmp

###

### 184x184 Pixel

Large=Avatar184.bmp

I believe the Steam Emu is applied twice: one for the game and one for the launcher.
So, probably need to edit the .ini file for both locations.

(1) {game folder}/Launcher/

(2) {game folder} bin/

If you have only one steam_emu.ini, just do it for that one, it should work.
